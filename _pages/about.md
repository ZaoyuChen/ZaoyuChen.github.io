​Hiii! I am a PhD student at Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xiao-Ming Wu](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxmwu/).

Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Li](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/felix831204).

# Research Interests
My research interests lie in Code Generation, AI + Blockchain.  

Previously, during my bachelor's studies, I worked on photonic spin-orbit coupling.

😊 **I am open to collaborations and discussions.** *Please feel free to contact me.*
